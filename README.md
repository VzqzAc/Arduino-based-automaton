# Binary-to-ABC..-arduino
A simple arduino-based automaton that converts binary input to ascii alphabet (letters and space), showing the current input on a display where also is shown if an error on the input occurs.

At the moment the code is not commented and it might be confused to understand.

COMING SOON: Commented code, rules governing the automaton, schemas...
